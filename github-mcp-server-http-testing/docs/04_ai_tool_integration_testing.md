# Phase 4: AI Tool Integration Testing

This is the final and most critical phase, ensuring the new HTTP server integrates seamlessly with the intended AI development tools.

## General Approach for Each Tool

For each AI development tool (RooCode, ClineAI, Gemini-CLI, Codex-CLI), the following steps will be performed:

1.  **Configuration:**
    *	**Goal:** Configure the AI tool to connect to the `github-mcp-http-server` running as a remote HTTP server.
    *	**Steps:**
        *	Identify the configuration file or method used by the specific AI tool to define external MCP servers.
        *	Add a new MCP server entry with `type: "streamable-http"`, `url: "http://localhost:8080/"` (or the appropriate host/port if running remotely), and any necessary authentication headers (e.g., `X-API-Key` if implemented later).
    *	**Expected Results:** The AI tool successfully identifies and attempts to connect to the `github-mcp-http-server`.

2.  **Execution and Verification:**
    *	**Goal:** Perform a series of tasks within the AI tool that utilize the GitHub MCP server, and verify correct functionality.
    *	**Steps:**
        *	Launch the AI tool.
        *	Execute commands or prompt the AI to perform actions that call various GitHub tools (e.g., list repositories, create an issue, get file content).
        *	Monitor the AI tool's output for success or failure.
        *	Monitor the `github-mcp-http-server` Docker container logs for incoming requests and responses to ensure the communication is happening as expected.
        *	Verify the actual state changes in GitHub (e.g., a new issue created, a comment added).

    *	**Expected Results:**
        *	All AI tool operations that rely on the GitHub MCP server complete successfully.
        *	The AI tool's behavior is consistent with direct API calls to GitHub via the MCP server.
        *	No errors or unexpected behavior are observed in either the AI tool or the `github-mcp-http-server` logs.
        *	GitHub reflects the expected changes (e.g., new issues, comments, file updates).

## Specific Tools to Test

### 1. RooCode

*	**Configuration:** Update `cline_mcp_settings.json` or similar configuration for RooCode.
*	**Tasks:** Attempt to list repositories, create a dummy issue, and retrieve contents of a file from a public repository.

### 2. ClineAI

*	**Configuration:** Update `cline_mcp_settings.json` or similar configuration for ClineAI.
*	**Tasks:** Similar to RooCode, test core GitHub functionalities through ClineAI's interface.

### 3. Gemini-CLI

*	**Configuration:** Configure the Gemini-CLI to use the new HTTP server endpoint.
*	**Tasks:** Use Gemini-CLI commands that interact with GitHub (e.g., search for issues, list pull requests).

### 4. Codex-CLI

*	**Configuration:** Configure the Codex-CLI to use the new HTTP server endpoint.
*	**Tasks:** Execute Codex-CLI commands that leverage GitHub functionalities.
